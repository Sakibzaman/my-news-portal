    <h2>1. What are the differences between var, let and const?</h2>
    <p>
      The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in
      JavaScript include: Variables declared with var and const are scoped to
      the immediate function body. Variables declared with the var keyword are
      hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their
      enclosing scope even before they are declared. Variables declared with the
      let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to
      the immediate enclosing block.
    </p>
    <h2>
      2. What are the differences between Arrow Function and Regular Function?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are
      constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible,
      they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are
      only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used
      as constructor functions.
    </p>
    <h2>3. What are the differences between map, forEach, filter and find?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>.map()</strong> executes the same code on every element in an
      array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
      <strong>.forEach()</strong>, is used to execute the same code on every
      element in an array but does not change the array and it returns
      undefined. <strong>.filter()</strong> checks every element in an array to
      see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the
      elements that return truthy for the criteria.
      <strong>.find()</strong> executes only the first element in an array to
      see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the first
      element that return truthy for the criteria.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Why should you use TemplateString?</h2>
    <p>
      Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in
      ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings
      without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
      allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.
      Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are
      functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
      parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.
